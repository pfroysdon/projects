0.2 First Revision

The first documentation of the RINEX Version 2 Format was published by
W. Gurtner and G. Mader in the CSTG GPS Bulletin of September/October 1990.
The main reason for a revision is the new treatment of antispoofing data by
the RINEX format (see chapter 7). Chapter 4 gives a recommendation for data
compression procedures, especially useful when large amounts of data are
exchanged through computer networks. In Table A3 in the original paper the
definiton of the "PGM / RUN BY / DATE" navigation header record was
missing, although the example showed it. The redefinition of AODE/AODC to
IODE/IODC also asked for an update of the format description. For consistency
reasons we also defined a Version 2 format for the Meteorological Data files
(inclusion of a END OF HEADER record and an optional MARKER NUMBER record).

The slight modification (or rather the definition of a bit in the Loss of Lock
Indicator unused so far) to flag AS data is so small a change that we decided
to NOT increase the version number!


0.3 Later Revisions

* URA Clarification (10-Dec-93):

  The user range accuracy in the Navigation Message File did not contain
  a definition of the units: There existed two ways of interpretation:
  Either the 4 bit value from the original message or the converted value
  in meters according to GPS ICD-200. In order to simplify the interpretation
  for the user of the RINEX files I propose the bits to be converted into
  meters prior to RINEX file creation.

* GLONASS Extensions:

  In March 1997 a proposal for extensions to the current RINEX definitions
  based on experiences collected with GLONASS only and mixed GPS/GLONASS data
  files was circulated among several instrument manufacturers and software
  developers.

  The results of the call for comments have been worked into this document.
  A separate document (glonass.txt) summarizes just the necessary extensions.

* A blank satellite identifier is allowed in pure GPS files only

* Met sensor description and position records were added to facilitate the
  precise use of met values.

* Description and examples for wavelength factors and their temporary changes
  (bit 1 of LLI) clarified.

* The RINEX documentation distributed in spring 1997 contained definitions for
  the GLONASS satellite clock offset and drift with the intention to have them
  defined identically to the GPS values. Unfortunately the GLONASS Interface
  Document consulted had a sign error in one of the formulae.

  The values should be stored into the RINEX file as -TauN, +GammaN, -TauC.
  The original definition asked for -TauN, -GammaN, +TauC. See paragraph 8.2.

  To avoid problems with files created with the original definitions a real
  valued version number (2.01) has been introduced for GLONASS nav mess files.

* IGS decided to use the Hatanaka compression scheme for RINEX observation
  files. Below the corresponding RINEX file name conventions are included
  as recommendations. The DOS naming (extension .yyE) was wrongly set to
  .yyY in the March 1998 version of the document.

* GPS week: The GPS week number in all RINEX files is a continuous number
  not affected by the 1024 roll-over, it runs from 1023 over 1024 to 1025 etc.

* A descrepancy between the definition of the header line fields of met sensor
  description and position in Table A5 and the example in Table A9 was removed.
  The latter was correct.

* Clarification for phase data format overflows: Add or subtract a suitable
  number of cycles, set LLI flag.

* Clarification for the GLONASS satellite identifier: "Almanac number" was
  somewhat ambiguous. It has been replaced by "slot number" within the
  satellite constellation.


0.4 Version 2.10 Modifications

The modifications leading to Version 2.10 include:

- Fractional version number
- Zero padding of 2-digit year values (years 2000-2009 --> 00-09)
- Field length of time of first obs (1/10 microsecond resolution)
- Non-integer sampling rate (INTERVAL header record)
- Header records now allowed after all epoch flags >1
- Additional obs types in obs files: S1, S2 (raw signal strength values)
- Receiver clock offset header line to clarify applied corrections
- Default wavelength factor header line mandatory
- Inmarsat GPS payloads: New satellite system definition, new nav mess files
- Curve fit interval in GPS nav mess file
- Redefinition of SV health value in GPS nav mess file
- Additional obs types in met files (ZD, ZT)


0.5 Version 2.10 Revisions

* "Header records now allowed after all epoch flags >2" in paragraph 0.4
  should read ">1"

* The original intention of the RINEX format was to allow for variable record
  lengths of the ASCII files to minimize the file size. Empty fields or
  unknown values can either be represented by zeroes or blank space. Most
  RINEX converters removed trailing blank to further reduce the file size. The
  documentation was not clear enough to explicitely allow for this practice
  (paragraphs 2, 5.3, 9.1).

* The time system identifier of GPS observations generated by GEO payloads
  defaults to GPS (explicitly stated now in paragraph 9.1)

* The time system identifier in the TIME OF LAST OBS header record has to
  be identical to the one in the TIME OF FIRST OBS record

* Clarification of Table A2 to be compatible with examples of Table A7:
  For event flags without significant epoch the epoch fields can be left blank.
  Table A6: Format for epoch contained obvious errors

* Clarification of the floating point exponent format in navigation message
  files (two digits, E,e,D,d letters)

* The newer GLONASS satellites started using frequency numbers in the 0 to     |
  -7 range. Table A11 BROADCAST ORBIT - 2 was modified accordingly.            |

1. THE PHILOSOPHY OF RINEX

The first proposal for the "Receiver Independent Exchange Format" RINEX has
been developed by the Astronomical Institute of the University of Berne for
the easy exchange of the GPS data to be collected during the large European
GPS campaign EUREF 89, which involved more than 60 GPS receivers of 4
different manufacturers. The governing aspect during the development was
the following fact:

Most geodetic processing software for GPS data use a well-defined set of
observables:

- the carrier-phase measurement at one or both carriers (actually being a
measurement on the beat frequency between the received carrier of the
satellite signal and a receiver-generated reference frequency).

- the pseudorange (code) measurement, equivalent to the difference of the
time of reception (expressed in the time frame of the receiver) and the
time of transmission (expressed in the time frame of the satellite) of a
distinct satellite signal.

- the observation time being the reading of the receiver clock at the
instant of validity of the carrier-phase and/or the code measurements.

Usually the software assumes that the observation time is valid for both
the phase AND the code measurements, AND for all satellites observed.

Consequently all these programs do not need most of the information that is
usually stored by the receivers:  They need phase, code, and time in the
above mentioned definitions, and some station-related information like
station name, antenna height, etc.


2. GENERAL FORMAT DESCRIPTION

Currently the format consists of six ASCII file types:

   1. Observation Data File
   2. Navigation Message File
   3. Meteorological Data File
   4. GLONASS Navigation Message File
   5. GEO Navigation Message File
   6. Satellite and Receiver Clock Date File

(The format definition of the clock files has been published in 1998
in a separate document by Jim Ray and Werner Gurtner, available at the IGS
Central Bureau Information System: ftp://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/igscb/data/
format/rinex_clock.txt).

Each file type consists of a header section and a data section. The header
section contains global information for the entire file and is placed at
the beginning of the file. The header section contains header labels in
columns 61-80 for each line contained in the header section. These labels
are mandatory and must appear exactly as given in these descriptions and
examples.

The format has been optimized for mimimum space requirements independent
from the number of different observation types of a specific receiver by
indicating in the header the types of observations to be stored. In
computer systems allowing variable record lengths the observation records
may be kept as short as possible. Trailing blanks can be removed from the
records. The maximum record length is 80 bytes per record.

Each Observation file and each Meteorological Data file basically contain
the data from one site and one session. RINEX Version 2 also allows to
include observation data from more than one site subsequently occupied by
a roving receiver in rapid static or kinematic applications. Although Version 2
allows to insert header records into the data field we do not recommend to
concatenate data of more than one receiver (or antenna) into the same file,
even if the data do not overlap in time.

If data from more than one receiver has to be exchanged it would not be
economical to include the identical satellite messages collected by the
different receivers several times. Therefore the Navigation Message File
from one receiver may be exchanged or a composite Navigation Message File
created containing non-redundant information from several receivers in
order to make the most complete file.

The format of the data records of the RINEX Version 1 Navigation Message
file is identical to the former NGS exchange format.

The actual format descriptions as well as examples are given in the Tables
at the end of the paper.


3. DEFINITION OF THE OBSERVABLES

GPS observables include three fundamental quantities that need to be defined:
Time, Phase, and Range.

TIME:

  The time of the measurement is the receiver time of the received signals.
  It is identical for the phase and range measurements and is identical for
  all satellites observed at that epoch. It is expressed in GPS time (not
  Universal Time).

PSEUDO-RANGE:

  The pseudo-range (PR) is the distance from the receiver antenna to the
  satellite antenna including receiver and satellite clock offsets (and
  other biases, such as atmospheric delays):

    PR  =  distance +
           c * (receiver clock offset - satellite clock offset +
                other biases)

  so that the pseudo-range reflects the actual behavior of the receiver
  and satellite clocks. The pseudo-range is stored in units of meters.

  See also clarifications for pseudoranges in mixed GPS/GLONASS files in
  chapter 8.1.

PHASE:

  The phase is the carrier-phase measured in whole cycles at both L1 and
  L2. The half-cycles measured by sqaring-type receivers must be converted
  to whole cycles and flagged by the wavelength factor in the header
  section.

  The phase changes in the same sense as the range (negative doppler). The
  phase observations between epochs must be connected by including the
  integer number of cycles. The phase observations will not contain any
  systematic drifts from intentional offsets of the reference oscillators.

The observables are not corrected for external effects like atmospheric
refraction, satellite clock offsets, etc.

If the receiver or the converter software adjusts the measurements using
the real-time-derived receiver clock offsets dT(r), the consistency of the
3 quantities phase / pseudo-range / epoch must be maintained, i.e. the
receiver clock correction should be applied to all 3 observables:

  Time(corr)  = Time(r)  -  dT(r)
  PR(corr)    =  PR(r)   -  dT(r)*c
  phase(corr) = phase(r) -  dT(r)*freq

DOPPLER:

The sign of the doppler shift as additional observable is defined as usual:
Positive for approaching satellites.


4. THE EXCHANGE OF RINEX FILES:

We recommend using the following naming convention for RINEX files:

        ssssdddf.yyt      ssss:    4-character station name designator
                           ddd:    day of the year of first record
                             f:    file sequence number within day
                                   0: file contains all the existing
                                      data of the current day
                            yy:    year
                             t:    file type:
                                   O: Observation file
                                   N: Navigation file
                                   M: Meteorological data file
                                   G: GLONASS Navigation file
                                   H: Geostationary GPS payload nav mess file
                                   B: Geostationary GPS payload broadcast data
                                   C: Clock files (see separate documentation)

When data transmission times or storage volumes are critical we recommend
compressing the files prior to storage or transmission using the UNIX
"compress" und "uncompress" programs. Compatible routines are available on
VAX/VMS and PC/DOS systems, as well.

Proposed naming conventions for the compressed files:

File Types                      UNIX            VMS             DOS

Obs Files                       ssssdddf.yyO.Z  ssssdddf.yyO_Z  ssssdddf.yyY
Obs Files (Hatanaka compr)      ssssdddf.yyD.Z  ssssdddf.yyD_Z  ssssdddf.yyE
GPS Nav Files                   ssssdddf.yyN.Z  ssssdddf.yyN_Z  ssssdddf.yyX
GLONASS Nav File                ssssdddf.yyG.Z  ssssdddf.yyG_Z  ssssdddf.yyV
GEO Nav Files                   ssssdddf.yyH.Z  ssssdddf.yyH_Z  ssssdddf.yyU
GEO Broadcast Files             ssssdddf.yyB.Z  ssssdddf.yyB_Z
Met Data Files                  ssssdddf.yyM.Z  ssssdddf.yyM_Z  ssssdddf.yyW

5. RINEX VERSION 2 FEATURES


The following section contains features that have been introduced for RINEX
Version 2:


5.1 Satellite Numbers:

Version 2 has been prepared to contain GLONASS or other satellite systems'
observations. Therefore we have to be able to distinguish the satellites
of the different systems:  We precede the 2-digit satellite number with a
system identifier.

        snn                  s:    satellite system identifier
                                   G or blank : GPS
                                   R          : GLONASS
                                   S          : Geostationary signal payload
                                   T          : Transit

                            nn:    - PRN (GPS), slot number (GLONASS)
                                   - PRN-100 (GEO)
                                   - two-digit Transit satellite number

        Note: G is mandatory in mixed GPS/GLONASS files

                                   (blank default modified in April 1997)

5.2 Order of the Header Records:

As the record descriptors in columns 61-80 are mandatory, the programs
reading a RINEX Version 2 header are able to decode the header records with
formats according to the record descriptor, provided the records have been
first read into an internal buffer.

We therefore propose to allow free ordering of the header records, with the
following exceptions:

- The "RINEX VERSION / TYPE" record must be the first record in a file

- The default "WAVELENGTH FACT L1/2" record must precede all records defining
  wavelength factors for individual satellites

- The "# OF SATELLITES" record (if present) should be immediately followed
  by the corresponding number of "PRN / # OF OBS" records. (These records
  may be handy for documentary purposes. However, since they may only be
  created after having read the whole raw data file we define them to be
  optional.


5.3 Missing Items, Duration of the Validity of Values

Items that are not known at the file creation time can be set to zero or
blank or the respective record may be completely omitted. Consequently
items of missing header records will be set to zero or blank by the program
reading RINEX files. Trailing blanks may be truncated from the record.

Each value remains valid until changed by an additional header record.


5.4 Event Flag Records

The "number of satellites" also corresponds to the number of records of the
same epoch followed. Therefore it may be used to skip the appropriate
number of records if certain event flags are not to be evaluated in detail.


5.5 Receiver Clock Offset

A large number of users asked to optionally include a receiver-derived
clock offset into the RINEX format. In order to remove uncertainties if
the data (epoch, pseudorange, phase) have been previously corrected or not
by the reported clock offset, RINEX Version 2.10 requests a clarifying (new)
header record.

It would then be possible to reconstruct the original observations if
necessary.

As the output format for the receiver-derived clock offset is limited to
nanoseconds the offset should be rounded to the nearest nanosecond before it
is used to correct the observables in order to guarantee correct
reconstruction.


6. ADDITIONAL HINTS AND TIPS

6.1 Version 1 / Version 2

Programs developed to read RINEX Version 1 files have to verify the version
number. Version 2 files may look different (version number, END OF HEADER
record, receiver and antenna serial number alphanumeric) even if they do
not use any of the new features


6.2 Leading Blanks in CHARACTER fields

We propose that routines to read RINEX Version 2 files automatically delete
leading blanks in any CHARACTER input field. Routines creating RINEX
Version 2 files should also left-justify all variables in the CHARACTER
fields.


6.3 Variable-length Records

DOS, and other, files may have variable record lengths, so we recommend to
first read each observation record into a 80-character blank string and
decode the data afterwards. In variable length records, empty data fields
at the end of a record may be missing, especially in the case of the
optional receiver clock offset.


6.4 Blank Fields

In view of future modifications we recommend to carefully skip any fields
currently defined to be blank (Format fields nX), because they may be assigned
to new contents in future versions.


6.5 2-Digit Years

RINEX version 2 stores the years of data records with two digits only. The
header of observation files contains a TIME OF FIRST OBS record with the full
four-digit year, the GPS nav messages contain the GPS week numbers. From these
two data items the unambiguous year can easily be reconstructed.

A hundred-year ambiguity occurs in the met data and GLONASS and GEO nav
messages: Instead of introducing a new TIME OF FIRST OBS header line it is
safeto stipulate that any two-digit years in RINEX Version 1 and Version 2.xx
files are understood to represent

                80-99:  1980-1999
                00-79:  2000-2079

Full 4-digit year fields could then be defined by a future RINEX version 3.


6.6 Fit Interval

Bit 17 in word 10 of subframe 2 is a "fit interval" flag which indicates the
curve-fit interval used by the GPS Control Segment in determining the
ephemeris parameters, as follows (see ICD-GPS-200, 20.3.3.4.3.1):

                0 = 4 hours
                1 = greater than 4 hours.

Together with the IODC values and Table 20-XII the actual fit interval can be
determined. The second value in the last record of each message shall contain
the fit interval in hours determined using IODC, fit flag, and Table 20-XII,
according to the Interface Document ICD-GPS-200.


6.7 Satellite Health

The health of the signal components (bits 18 to 22 of word three in subframe
one) are now (Version 2.10) included into the health value reported in the
second field of the sixth nav mess records.

A program reading RINEX files could easily decide if bit 17 only or all bits
(17-22) have been written:

RINEX Value:   0    Health OK
RINEX Value:   1    Health not OK (bits 18-22 not stored)
RINEX Value: >32    Health not OK (bits 18-22 stored)


6.8 Transmission Time of Message (Navigation message file)

The transmission time of message can be shortly before midnight
Saturday/Sunday, the TOE and TOC of the message already in the next week.
As the reported week in the RINEX nav message (BROADCAST ORBIT - 5 record)
goes with ToE (this is different from the GPS week in the original satellite
message!), the transmission time of message should be reduced by 604800
(i.e., will become negative) to also refer to the same week.


7. RINEX UNDER ANTISPOOFING (AS)

Some receivers generate code delay differences between the first and second
frequency using cross-correlation techniques when AS is on and may recover
the phase observations on L2 in full cycles. Using the C/A code delay on
L1 and the observed difference it is possible to generate a code delay
observation for the second frequency.

Other receivers recover P code observations by breaking down the Y code
into P and W code.

Most of these observations may suffer from an increased noise level. In
order to enable the postprocessing programs to take special actions, such
AS-infected observations are flagged using bit number 2 of the Loss of Lock
Indicators (i.e. their current values are increased by 4).


8. GLONASS Extensions

8.1 RINEX Observation File

8.1.1 Time System Identifier

The original RINEX Version 2 needed one major supplement, the explicit
definition of the time system:

GLONASS is basically running on UTC (or, more precisely, GLONASS system time
linked to UTC(SU)), i.e. the time tags are given in UTC and not GPS time.
In order to remove possible misunderstandings and ambiguities, the header
records "TIME OF FIRST OBS" and (if present) "TIME OF LAST OBS" in GLONASS and
GPS observation files _can_, in mixed GLONASS/GPS observation files _must_
contain a time system identifier defining the system that all time tags in the
file are referring to: "GPS" to identify GPS time, "GLO" to identify the
GLONASS UTC time system. Pure GPS files default to GPS and pure GLONASS files
default to GLO.

Format definitions see Table A1.

Hence, the two possible time tags differ by the current number of leap seconds.

In order to have the current number of leap seconds available we recommend
to include a LEAP SECOND line into the RINEX header.

If there are known non-integer biases between the "GPS receiver clock"
and "GLONASS receiver clock" in the same receiver, they should be applied.
In this case the respective code and phase observations have to be corrected,
too (c * bias if expressed in meters).

Unknown such biases will have to be solved for during the post processing

The small differences (modulo 1 second) between GLONASS system time, UTC(SU),
UTC(USNO) and GPS system time have to be dealt with during the post-processing
and not before the RINEX conversion. It may also be necessary to solve for
remaining differences during the post-processing.

8.1.2 Pseudorange Definition

The pseudorange (code) measurement is defined to be equivalent to the
difference of the time of reception (expressed in the time frame of the
receiver) and the time of transmission (expressed in the time frame of the
satellite) of a distinct satellite signal.

If a mixed-mode GPS/GLONASS receiver refers all pseudorange observations to
one receiver clock only,

- the raw GLONASS pseudoranges will show the current number of leap seconds
  between GPS time and GLONASS time if the receiver clock is running in the
  GPS time frame

- the raw GPS pseudoranges will show the negative number of leap seconds
  between GPS time and GLONASS time if the receiver clock is running in the
  GLONASS time frame

In order to avoid misunderstandings and to keep the code observations within
the format fields, the pseudoranges must be corrected in this case as follows:

  PR(GPS) := PR(GPS) + c * leap_seconds   if generated with a receiver clock
                                          running in the GLONASS time frame

  PR(GLO) := PR(GLO) - c * leap_seconds   if generated with a receiver clock
                                          running in the GPS time frame

to remove the contributions of the leap seconds from the pseudoranges.

"leap_seconds" is the actual number of leap seconds between GPS and GLONASS
(UTC) time, as broadcast in the GPS almanac and distributed in Circular T
of BIPM.

8.1.3 More Than 12 Satellites per Epoch

The format of the epoch / satellite line in the observation record part of
the RINEX Observation files has only been defined for up to 12 satellites
per epoch. We explicitly define now the format of the continuation lines,
see Table A2.


8.2 RINEX Navigation Files for GLONASS

As the GLONASS navigation message differs in contents from the GPS message
too much, a special GLONASS navigation message file format has been defined.

The header section and the first data record (epoch, satellite clock
information) is similar to the GPS navigation file. The following records
contain the satellite position, velocity and acceleration, the clock and
frequency biases as well as auxiliary information as health, satellite
frequency (channel), age of the information.

The corrections of the satellite time to UTC are as follows:

  GPS    : Tutc = Tsv - af0  -  af1  *(Tsv-Toc) - ... -  A0  - ... - leap_sec
  GLONASS: Tutc = Tsv + TauN - GammaN*(Tsv-Tb)        + TauC

***  In order to use the same sign conventions for the GLONASS corrections
     as in the GPS navigation files,  the broadcast GLONASS values are
     stored as:
                  -TauN, +GammaN, -TauC.

The time tags in the GLONASS navigation files are given in UTC (i.e. _not_
Moscow time or GPS time).

Filenaming convention: See above.


9.  RINEX Extensions for Geostationary Satellites (GPS Signal Payloads)

With the implementation of GNSS programs, GPS-like ranging measurements can be
performed on geostationary navigation payloads.

RINEX Version 2.10 defines the necessary extensions to handle such data in
RINEX files for data exchange and postprocessing purposes.


9.1 RINEX Observation Files for GEO Satellites

A new satellite system identifier has been defined for the geostationary
GPS signal payloads: "S", to be used in the RINEX VERSION / TYPE header line
and in the satellite identifier 'snn', nn being the GEO PRN number minus 100.

                   e.g.: PRN = 120 --> 'snn' = "S20"

In mixed dual frequency GPS satellite / single frequency GEO payload
observation files the fields for the second frequency observations of GEO
satellites remain blank, are set to zero values or (if last in the record)
can be truncated.

The time system identifier of GEO satellites generating GPS signals defaults
to GPS time.


9.2 RINEX Navigation Message Files for GEO Satellites

As the GEO broadcast orbit format differs from the GPS message a special GEO
navigation message file format has been defined which is nearly identical with
the GLONASS nav mess file format.

The header section contains informations about the generating program,
comments, and the difference between the GEO system time and UTC.

The first data record contains the epoch and satellite clock information,
the following records contain the satellite position, velocity and
acceleration and auxiliary information such as health, age of the data, etc.

The time tags in the GEO navigation files are given in the GPS time frame,
i.e. not UTC.

The corrections of the satellite time to UTC are as follows:

  GEO    : Tutc = Tsv - aGf0  -  aGf1 *(Tsv-Toe) -  W0  - leap_sec

W0 being the correction to transform the GEO system time to UTC. Toe, aGf0,
aGf1 see below in the format definition tables.

*  References for the definition of the accuracy and health codes still have *
*  to be defined.                                                            *
*  Help is needed here by colleagues working with such GEO data!             *
