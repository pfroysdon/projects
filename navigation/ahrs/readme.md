# AHRS state estimation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction
The "Attitude Heading and Reference System (AHRS) toolbox" uses real-time C++ functions, translated to Matlab, for simulation and post-processing using either real (recorded) data or synthetic data. Two AHRS algorthms, Mahony and Madgwick, are implemented.

The demo script demonstrates use of the Madgwick AHRS and Mahony AHRS algorithms with example data. ExampleData.mat contains calibrated  gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data logged from an inexpensive IMU while it was sequentially rotated from 0 degrees, to +90 degree and then to -90 degrees around the X, Y and Z axis.  The script processes the data through the algorithm, then plots the example sensor data and output as Euler angles.

Note that the Euler angle plot shows erratic behaviour in phi and psi when theta approaches Â±90 degrees. This due to a singularity in the Euler angle sequence known as 'Gimbal lock'.  This issue does not exist for a quaternion or rotation matrix representation. 


# Requirements
This toolbox was been developed and tested in Matlab 8.6 64-bit on Windows 7 & 10, other versions of both Windows and Matlab 
may work but are not guaranteed. The following elements are needed in order to use this Toolbox:

- A computer with Windows 7 or 10 (64-bit is preferred).
- A Matlab r2015a (8.6) installation (64-bit is preferred).  


# Operation
Use of the toolbox is quite simple, with default values which work for most cases. The code is well commented, so you should read the header of each file to understand the input/output, as well as the body of the code to understand the variables and parameters.


## MAIN File
The main run file is located in the root directory, labeled "MAIN_ ... .m", while user selectable options are located in the "CONFIG_ ... .m".

## Example  
To run the simulation with test data, simply run the "MAIN_ ... .m" file. This will load the data, run the necessary functions, and plot the results. All saved data (.mat, .doc, .jpg, .fig, etc.) are saved in the "[root]/results" directory.

## Final Note 
If you are not sure of what settings to use, leave as default!  The default values are set to run as a "demo" mode, exercising most features of this toolbox.


# Notation Conventions
In general, the names of the varaibles are as specific as possible, and reflect naming conventions used in literature. 
Some examples below.

"r_u_ecef" Describes the position (r) of the user (_u) in the ECEF reference frame (_ecef).

"ecef2ned_pva()" Is a functions which converts position|velocity|attitude (_pva) from the ECEF reference frame to the NED reference frame (ecef2ned).

"R_a_b" Describes a rotation matrix from frame "a" (latex subscript _a) to frame "b" (latex superscript ^b).
