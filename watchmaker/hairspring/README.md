# Hairspring Calculations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction

This project contains a complete report of the equations, derivations and unit conversion to calculate the length of a hairspring for any material, thickness, and height.  A spreadsheet "calculator" is also provided, to automatically calculate the length given a few input parameters.
