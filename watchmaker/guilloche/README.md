# Project Overview
This toolbox generates complex geometric patterns for wrist watch dials, then simulates the results, then generates the tool paths and g-code (machine code) for use on a CNC mill.

 - The code is in the "matlab" directory.
 - g-code is in the "nc_files" directory.
 - Simulation results are in the "results" directory.
 - Brass plate examples of the g-code used on a 3-axis CNC mill are in the "photos" directory.
