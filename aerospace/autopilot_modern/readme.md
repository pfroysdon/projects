# Autopilot - modern equations

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction

This autopilot uses **modern control theory** with a nonlinear controller and command filtered backstepping.  

The navigation system consists of a GPS-aided INS with a **full-nonlinear optimal Bayesian state estimation system** (more advanced than the Kalman Filter).  See the [tech note](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/aerospace/autopilot_modern/tech_note) for more information.

The "autopilot - modern equations" is a full-functional autopilot and navigation system, built in C/C++ and uses a specifically designed PCB, that is able to control the following aerial vehicles:

- Airplane (cruciform tail and vee-tail)
- Delta wing
- Flying Wing
- Helicopter
- Bi-copter
- Tri-copter
- Quadcopter (both + and X configurations)
- Y4 multicopter
- Y6 multicopter
- Hexacopter (both + and X configurations)
- Octocopter (double-quad, flat +, flat X, flat V)
