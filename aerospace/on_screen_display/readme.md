# On Screen Display

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction
The "on-screen display (OSD)" is a full-functional OSD, built in C/C++ and uses a specifically designed PCB, designed for aerial vehicles.


# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the many contributions to the open source community for software and hardware ideas.
I have included what I believe to be the best from what I have seen on many platforms and combined them 
into this OSD software and hardware.

Specifically I would like to thank:
	•	Bill Premerlani for his innovative navigation and controls software architecture.
	•	The MultiWii team for their compact integer-based core C-code architecture.
	•	The SparkFun team for their unique approach to electronics hardware.

Each of these groups of people from all around the world have contributed to the general development and testing 
of multicopters, and each of them has contributed unique code, designs and ideas.  Thank you all.
